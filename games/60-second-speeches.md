# 60 second speeches

## Description
The facilitator has different topics (candy, state advisors, television, summer, parents) pre-written on pieces of paper. One by one, participants will pick a topic from the facilitator and must give a 60 second speech on that topic.

The only rule is that they must begin immediately (give people 5-10 seconds) and not stop talking or hesitate too long!
