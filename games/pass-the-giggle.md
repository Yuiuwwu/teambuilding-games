# Pass the Giggle

## Description
The committee lies on the ground in a way so that every member has his/her head on the stomach of another person. Only the head of the first person of the line lies on the ground. The first person starts to "pass the giggle" (e.g. laugh/giggle loudly, making their tummy bounce) and the next person has to pass it on. Then it starts again with a new giggle.
