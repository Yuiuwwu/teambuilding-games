# Ball energiser

## Description
Participants stand in a circle, and the chair tosses out one ball and keeps adding balls. The participants continue to toss to the same person while keeping all the balls in the air as a group.
The discussion continues while the rhythm keeps slowly increasing.

## Description
Choose a topic of discussion - keeps it more focussed
Make it a story telling game - more confusing
