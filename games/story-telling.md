# Story Telling

## Description
Three people go into a hall or are otherwise isolated from the group. A story is told to the others. No notes are allowed. The story should be about 2-3 minutes in length and contain many details. Then, one of the isolated people is called in. A group member repeats the story as he/she remembers it to the isolated person. Then another isolated person is called in and the first isolated person passes on what he/she remembers. This continues until all isolated people have heard the story. Afterwards, the audience is allowed to comment on the final version of the story, and the original is read out again.
