# Shout the Syllable

## Description
To be played after the first round of name games. Make the group stand in a
circle. One person starts shouting the first syllable of their name, the other
follow one by one. When the sound comes back to the person whose name is
being shouted, everybody screams the missing part of the name at the same
time.
