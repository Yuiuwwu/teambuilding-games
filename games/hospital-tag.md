# Hospital Tag

## Description
This is another variant on classic game of Tag. One person is It and when they tag someone the victim is also 'It. But wherever they were tagged they cannot use that part of their body, i.e.: if tagged on the leg then they must hop or if it was their arm of hip they must hold it and not use it.
After a while, everyone should have a few useless limbs. The game ends when the first person falls over.
