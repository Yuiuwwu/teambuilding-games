# Frog Song

## Description
You sing the following song, and the rest of the group sings along with you. On "Um-ha" pull your cheeks and stick your tounge out, then make up a gesture for each word in "But we know frogs go". Increase speed.

Um - ha said a little green frog one day
Um - ha said a little green frog (x2)

Buuuut we know frogs go
Sha - la - la - la - la (x3)
We know frogs go
Sha - la - la - la - la
They don't go ouh - ah - aah
