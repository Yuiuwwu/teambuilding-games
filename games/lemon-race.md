# Lemon Race

## Description
First divide the group into two (or more) equal lines. Then give the leader of
each line a full length pencil and a full-grown lemon. As the teams line up mark a starting line and finish line on the floor (about 30 metres away at most). The aim of the game is to push the lemon with the pencil along the floor in a straight line(!). Each player must push it to the finish line and back to the next team mate waiting in the line. The team to finish first wins.
