# Shark Attack

## Description
Lyrics:

There was a boy (raise arm and tap arm muscles with other hand)
Do do do do do do (between every line)

And a girl (create 'girl shape' with hands in front of you')
They drove to the beach (pretend to drive with one hand)
And it was hot (wipe forehead and say 'phew')
Very hot (wipe forehead and say 'phew')
VERY hot (wipe forehead and say 'phew')
And they dove in (diving motion)
And swam out (swimming motion)
Further out (swimming motion)
FURTHER out (swimming motion)
But ... there were SHARKS
AHHHHHH (instead of do do do do ...)

Papa Shark (biting motion with full arms (e.g. right top))
Mama Shark (biting motion with full arms, other way around (e.g. left top)) 
Brother Shark (biting notion with arms together at elbows)
Sister Shark (biting notion with arms together at elbows, other way around)
Baby Shark (biting motion, hands held together at wrists)  
Grandma Shark (use both hands made into fists together (like dentures))
Grandpa Shark (same, other way around)

[choose differenty types of shark - chair shark, Italian, Swiss, Britney Spears etc.]

The grabbed a leg (grab leg of person to your left)
Another one (grab leg of person to you right)
They grabbed an arm (grab arm of person to your left)
Another one (grab arm of person to you right)
They grabbed a head (grab head of person to your left)
Another one (grab head of person to you right)
And all was quiet (slow sweeping motion)
And all was red (slow sweeping motion)
No boy no girl (slow sweeping motion)
They all were dead (pause)

But.
THERE WERE SHARKS
AAAAAH

(repeat the sharks)
