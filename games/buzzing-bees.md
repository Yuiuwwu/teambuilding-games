# Buzzing Bees

## Description
All the delegates are blindfolded and are walking in a rectangular plane saying an "mmm" sound. The facilitator taps one delegate who is then allowed to open his or her eyes and stop saying "mmm". The other delegates task is to find the quiet, sighted person.
The ones who find the group of sighted people also become quiet and are allowed to take off the blindfolds. They are not allowed to talk until everyone in the group has found his/her way to them.
