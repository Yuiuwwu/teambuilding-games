# Famous Pairs

## Description
Write down the names of famous pairs or couples like Brad and Angelina or Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni on several different cards with each name on an individual card.
Each card is stuck to a delegates forehead. Delegates then walk around asking only "yes" and "no" questions to figure out what name is written on their card and find their partner.

The first two people to discover that they are pairs win the game. Or keep going until only two pairs are left
