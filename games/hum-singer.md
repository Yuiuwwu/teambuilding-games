# Hum Singer

## Description
This game can be used to form pairs or subgroups in a more creative way. Each person receives an index card with the title of a well known song printed on it. You may want to use both sides of the card for two rounds of this game, but be sure to delineate the sides so on each round every one is on the same page. Everyone begins to hum or sing the tune of the song found on his/her card. The goal is for each person to find the other person(s) who are humming/singing the same song.

## Description
Once the subgroups are formed, students may exchange information about themselves to make it a 'Getting to Know' game.
