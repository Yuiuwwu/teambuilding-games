# Gum Game

## Description
Set up teams of five. Each team will receive one pair of new garden gloves and
one pack of chewing gum (5 pieces per pack). On go, the first person in each team is to put on the garden gloves, open the package of gum, pull out a piece, unwrap it, chew it, and then pass the gloves to the next person. The first team to complete the task wins. You can choose to have two packs of gum per team so that they would have to go around twice.

## Description
Can do the same with chocolate, knives and forks, and dice (each time you roll a six switch person) - once you get chosen you have to put on the gloves and use the knife and fork to eat the chocolate - makes game yummier.
