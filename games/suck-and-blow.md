# Suck and Blow

## Description
You will need an ordinary playing card Gather all the players into a circle. The
goal of the game is to get the playing card all the way around the circle by sucking on it and then blowing it to the next person. No hands allowed! The first player puts the card against her mouth and sucks air in to "stick" the card in place. The next player presses her lips to the other side of the card: at this point, the first player blows air out and the second player sucks air in. If everything works right, the card should now be stuck to the lips of the second player. It is quite a challenge to get the card all they way around the circle.
