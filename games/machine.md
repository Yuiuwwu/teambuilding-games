# Machine

## Description
One person starts being part of an imaginary machine of moving parts by making a random repetitive motion. One after the other, the group members join the machine and represent a different part of it. Example: the first person continuously rotates their left arm. The next person stands beside them and stamps their feet. The third person stands in front of the first person and 'links up' to the rotating arm with their hips, rocking back and forth etc.
