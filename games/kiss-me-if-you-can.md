# Kiss me if you can

## Description
Every participant gets a note with the name of one other participant. The game is played over the course of an event or any longer timeframe.

The task is now to kiss this persons neck without other people noticing. If they succeed, they take this persons note and try to hunt for another victim. If they fail, which means they were noticed by someone, they're out of the game.

Winner is the person who "killed" (kissed) the most.
