# Chicken Pilot

## Description
The group stands in a circle. Everyone is a chicken pilot and therefore wears pilot goggles, symbolised by holding two circles in front of your eyes, formed by making the thumb and index finger of each hand touch (turn hands upside down, i.e. with palms touching forehead, for added effect!). One person now points at another chicken pilot and makes a chicken sound, which is then sent around the circle. Any person who laughs has to run around the circle acting like a chicken, including sound and movement.
