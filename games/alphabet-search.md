# Alphabet Search

## Description
Divide the delegates into small groups.

Ask the group for objects that they have on them or with them. Make a list in alphabetical order with the names of the objects. First group to get a list with all 26 letters represented wins.

If done as a small group lends itself well to a small team building exercise as the group works together through the alphabet.
