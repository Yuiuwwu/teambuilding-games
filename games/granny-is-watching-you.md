# Granny is Watching You

## Description
One member of the team ("Granny") stands at a distance of approx. 15 meters to the team, which is lined up. He/she turns his/her back to the team. The aim is to approach Granny until you can touch her. Team members may only move when Granny has her head turned away from the team. When she turns around and she sees someone moving, she will send him/her back to the starting line. The person who catches Granny takes her place.
