# Grandmother's Footsteps

## Description
One person is chosen to be Grandmother and stands, with eyes shut, facing a wall. The other players line up at the opposite side of the room and, when everyone is ready, begin tot creep up behind Grandmother. Whenever Grandmother turns around, however, everyone in the room has to freeze like a statue. Grandmother may look around as often as he or she likes and when he or she catches someone moving, that person has to go back to the start and begin again form there. The first player to touch the wall wins and takes the next turn at being Grandmother.
