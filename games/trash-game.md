# Trash Game

## Description
The team has to split into 4 different groups. The first group builds a figure with natural material. The second group may watch this figure and reports in detail to the third group how this figure looked like. The third group must then report their knowledge to the fourth group, which must rebuild the figure in detail.

This will leave delegates (the inactive groups) waiting around, think beforehand of how you could use this or extend the game.
