# Fruit Salad

## Description
The delegates sit on chairs in a circle. There should be one chair less than there are delegates. Each delegate is named by a fruit e.g. banana, apple, pear, orange.

One of the delegates stands in the middle of the circle and says the name of the fruit e.g. if he says apple, all the apples must change seats. The delegate in the middle can now sit again if he finds a free seat. The delegate who is left without a seat must now go into the middle and the game begins again. If the delegate in the middle says "Fruit Salad", all members must change seat.
