# Name and Lie

## Description
Everyone stands in a circle. The group leader starts by miming an action. When the person on their right says their name and asks "Alfons, what are you doing?", they reply that they are doing something completely different.

For example, the group leader mimes swimming and says "I am washing my hair!". The person to the group leader's right then has to mime what the group leader said that they were doing (washing their hair), while saying that they are doing something completely different. Go around the circle in this way until everyone has had a turn.
