# Listening Meditation

## Description
Clear a space, clean the area from any clutter. This helps you transition into meditation mode and sets the stage for a calmer, more productive afternoon.

Log off, switch off phones and limit all distractions to free the mind up. Close your eyes and normalize your breathing. Sit up straight and take long inhalations, followed by longer exhalations. Continue this breathing throughout the entire exercise.

Begin listening: tune in to the sounds around you as if you were listening to
music. Focus on foreground and background noises, distant sounds and ambience. Check your body and mood and concentrate on relaxing. After several minutes, open your eyes. Notice the difference in group energy levels.
