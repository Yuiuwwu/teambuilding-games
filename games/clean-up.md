# Clean Up

## Description
This is typically done at the end of committee work when you need to clean up the room. However, it can be played at any time as long as you have a clear, delimitated area and lots of stuff lying around.

Split up the delegates into two teams and give them a limited amount of time to clean up the area. The team that cleans up the largest area gets a massage from the other.

## Description
Blindfold the delegates: Makes the game harder and doubles as a communication game. Only to play if you have a lot of time to spare.

Add criteria: In the end all material needs to be sorted by color, size, shape, etc. Doubles as problem solving and dealing with conflict.

No time limit: give each team a specific area and see which one is faster. Remind delegates they are allowed to mess with the other team, e.g. by dumping stuff in the other team's area: Deal with conflict, make them realise they need to cooperate or else the game will never end. BONUS: Very amusing to watch.
