# Silent Killer

## Description
The delegates are given a space in which to move. They put on their blindfolds and start moving around. The facilitator taps one person on the head to indicate that he/she is the killer. The killer will now move around to find victims, by touching their shoulders. The victims die with a melodramatic scream, giving a clue to the others about where the killer is.

## Description
The game can be moved along by using the victims who are already dead to form a circle around those who are left and closing in on them.
