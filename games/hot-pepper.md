# Hot Pepper

## Description
Participants sit in a circle away from the tables and close their eyes. The teambuilder gives a small ball to one participant who is instructed to pass the ball quickly to the next person saying "Hot!" 

Participants continue to pass the ball around the group. As the ball is passed from participant to participant, the teambuilder turns her/his back, closes eyes and calls out "Pepper!" The person who is holding the ball when "Pepper!" is called is removed from the circle. The ball continues to be passed until only one person is left.
