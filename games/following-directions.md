# Following Directions

## Description
Form pairs. Give each person a piece of paper. The partners sit back to back. One person is the creator and rips the paper into different shapes. In the meantime, he/she explains the different moves, while the other person in the pair tries to copy it. After a few minutes, the pairs turn around and compare, after which they switch roles.

## Description
You can tell them that questions are not allowed in the first round and then see whether this makes a difference in the second round, when questions are allowed.\n\nIn an alternative version of the game, both have a pen and the one who gives the instructions is making a drawing instead of ripping the paper in pieces.
