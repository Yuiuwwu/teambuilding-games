# Evolution

## Description
There are several (the exact number is up to the facilitator) different steps of
evolution. each of them represented by typical movement and sound. Make everybody walk around in the first step, making the moves and the sound. If they meet somebody which is on their same evolution level, they play stone, paper and scissors against each other. The winner is now one step higher in the evolution ladder. Aim is to get on the highest level and win a last time against somebody.
