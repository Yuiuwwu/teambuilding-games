# Ninja

## Description
This is a competitive turn-based game maybe more suitable for casual playing in breaks rather than teambuilding, as you will prefer to play in smaller groups of about 3-6 people.

Gather players and on your command, everyone jumps back and freezes in a ninja-like position. The youngest player starts and has one move. He can either jump to a new position or try to attack another player. He attacks by slapping the hand of another player who is allowed to react only in the last moment.

If he hits the hand, this player loses the hand (it goes on the back) and only has one life remaining (e.g. his other hand). After a successful hit, it's the attacking player's turn again.

If he misses, he needs to freeze and its immediately the attacked player's turn, who can as well either retaliate (often going into back-and-forth battles) or make a step away.

If a player chooses to move instead of attack, he calls the name of another player immediately afterwards. Alternatively, if a player moves, it's the next player's turn after a set order (f.e. circular), making the game faster and more devious.
