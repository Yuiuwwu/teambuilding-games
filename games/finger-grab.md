# Finger Grab

## Description
Group members stand in a circle, arms out to the side. Put left hands palm up. The right hand index finger is pointing out. The index finger should be touching their neighbour’s outstretched palm.

When the group leader says “Go!” everyone does two things: tries to grab the finger in their left hand's palm and tries to prevent their right finger from being grabbed. Suspense should be added with false starts or whatever the group leader wishes!
