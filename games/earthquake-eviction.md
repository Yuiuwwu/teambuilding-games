# Earthquake Eviction

## Description
One participant stands alone (Caller), the rest of the participants split into groups of three.\nThe groups of three have two people making a house by standing opposite each other with their fingertips touching, forming a triangle 'roof'. One person stands underneath the 'roof'.\nWhen the Caller calls "Eviction!" everyone in a house must leave and find a new one. The Caller may also call "Earthquake!" and all houses collapse and every one must form a new threesome of house and resident (former 'houses' can become new residents and vice versa).\n\nEither way, the Caller tries to get into one of the threesome, so the participant left behind becomes the new Caller.
