# Rocky Motivational

## Description
"Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor is played in the background.
The Teambuilder stands at the front of the group. Participants start running on the spot and by following the example set by the Teambuilder. They increase their speed while the song goes on. The Teambuilder is free to add additional elements, such as shadow boxing, shouting and cheering to create a livelier "story".
