# Common Link

## Description
Divide the group into teams of three or four. 

Each team has to come up with 5-10 different traits that are common to all members in the team -- brown hair, an older brother, etc. After five minutes or so, the teams share their common traits with the group. 

Points are scored for each trait that isn't also on someone else's list. So if two teams listed that everyone in the team wore glasses, neither team would get a point for that trait. 

The team with the most points wins, but so does everyone else, as you've all discovered some pretty interesting things about one another!
