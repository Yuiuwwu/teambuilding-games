# People to People

## Description
Everyone has a partner except for the leader. The leader chants body parts for
partners to touch. For example: "head to head" or "elbow to elbow." After doing a few of these the leader calls out "people to people," at which time everyone, including the leader, must find a new partner (thus there's a new leader). The game continues in this fashion.
