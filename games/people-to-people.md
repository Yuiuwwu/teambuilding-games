# People to People

## Description
Everyone has a partner except for the leader. The leader chants body parts for\npartners to touch. For example: \"head to head\" or \"elbow to elbow.\" After doing a few of these the leader calls out \"people to people,\" at which time everyone, including the leader, must find a new partner (thus there's a new leader). The game continues in this fashion.
