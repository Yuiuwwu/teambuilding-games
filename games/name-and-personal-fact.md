# Name and personal fact

## Description
Sit in a circle. The first person says his/her name and one personal fact (favourite food, earliest memory, address, etc.) The second person repeats the first delegate's name and fact and adds his/her own ones and so on. The last person has to repeat everyone's name. Delegates then change places within the circle and one volunteer attempts to give the names and sentences for everyone in this new order.
