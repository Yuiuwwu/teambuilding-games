# Hodgy Podgy

## Description
Participants stand in a circle, facing the center. The facilitator introduces a relatively slow rhythm (1st beat: slap both legs, 2nd  beat: clap hands, 3rd beat: snap fingers left hand, 4th beat: snap fingers right hand, repeat).
Everyone joins in. 

To start each round, the facilitator says (one beat per word), "Hodgy podgy, hodgy podgy!"
The facilitator then starts a sentence by saying any word on beat one (e.g., "Big"). The next participant in the circle continues the story by adding the next word in the sentence by the first beat of the next rhythm cycle (for example, "dogs"). The next person in line must continue the sentence.
Each word must make logical and grammatical sense when added to the sentence (eg: "Big-Dogs-Love-Cars!"). If a participant wants to end the sentence, he or she says a punctuation word, such as "period" or "exclamation point" or "question mark" and the next person in the circle starts a new sentence.
When a participant makes a mistake the round ends and they become the person who starts the next round.

## Description
Whenever one participant cannot continue, they drop out. Th next participant starts a new sentence.
