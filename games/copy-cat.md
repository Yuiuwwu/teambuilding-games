# Copy Cat

## Description
The committee is formed into a circle, and one delegate is asked to volunteer to be the "guesser". The guesser goes out of the circle and walks about 10-15 metres away (or goes behind a wall or tree if available.) The guesser then closes his or her eyes.

The idea is for the guesser to be unable to see what the rest of the circle is doing or to hear what they are saying. Among the rest of the circle, a delegate volunteers or is chosen to lead the group. The leader then begins making a motion and everyone else copies it. They do so, using any part of their body. Someone then yells to the guesser that the group is ready.

The guesser comes back and stands in the middle of the circle. The object is for the guesser to guess who the leader is. The leader can change the motion, and everyone else follows. It works best if not everyone looks at the leader. The guesser gets three guesses to guess who the leader is. If he/she guesses correctly, the person who started the motion is the one who is removed from the space for the next round.

After a third incorrect guess, the leader reveals him or her.
