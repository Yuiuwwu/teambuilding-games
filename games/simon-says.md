# Simon Says

## Description
One player is chosen as the leader, and the others stand around the room in front of him or her. The leader then gives commands that the others should either follow or ignore, depending on how the command is given. If the leader begins the command with "Simon says" then everyone should carry out his or her command. For example, if he/she says, "Simon says touch your toes" then the others should bend over and touch their toes. If, however, the leader just says, "Touch your toes" then the order should be ignored. If someone follows an order that did not have "Simon says" before it, then he/she is eliminated.\n\nThe leader can also mislead the other players by giving out the orders very fast, by carrying out him/her commands that were not preceded by "Simon Says", or by creating a rhythm of orders in a pattern that is then suddenly broken by a wrong command. The last player to be caught out is the winner and takes the place of the leader.

## Description
This is played in the same way as Simon Says except that the leader proceeds his or her orders with either "Do this" or "Do that".\nIf the command is "Do this" then all the players should copy his or her actions. If it is "Do that" then they should remain still:\n\n\"Do this: Arms up! Do this: Arms down! Do that: Arms up\"\n\nThose who end up with their arms up are eliminiated.
