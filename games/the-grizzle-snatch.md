# The grizzle snatch

## Description
People pair up, and an even amount of air-balloons is given to each couple. The balloons have been previously filled in a way that they are not likely to explode under small pressure (that is, its still safe to grasp them and gently squeeze them).\n \nAs the chair/trainer says 'go, each person has to place a balloon under their shirt on the backside, then they have to stick back to back to their partner and start rubbing until both balloons explode. \n\nThe first couples running out of balloons wins.

## Description
Alternatively, the energizer is played individually: people have to scratch their back against the wall (a good wake up before a meeting/committee work)
