# A Friendly Bunch

## Description
The participants stand in a circle. When the group leader shouts "Go", they need to hug as many people as possible in the next 30 seconds.

Play as many rounds as needed. The game can be played as a competition where the one who hugs most people wins. Upbeat music should be played during the game.

## Description
Variation: The participants need to hug all the other members as quickly as possible and then sit down.
