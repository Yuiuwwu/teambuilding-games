# All Aboard

## Description
The goal is to get a group of twelve to sixteen people on a two-foot square
platform without anyone touching the ground. Rules:

 Everyone in the group must remain on the platform for at least 10
￼￼seconds.
 Participants can not lay on top of each other, forming a dog pile, as a
solution to this activity.
