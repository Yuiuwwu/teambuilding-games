# Brainstorming Game

## Description
A shoe company has somehow made 1000 left shoes. It, for some reason, cannot manufacture right shows. It wants to sell the left shoes, but doesn't now how. The committee has to solve this problem.\n\nThe \"rules\" of brainstorming dictate, that no idea will be shot down and that no idea will be discussed. They are simply written down by each delegate on post-its (or on a flip-chart). Stop after five minutes of brainstorming. The committee reports its results. Did people follow the rules? How were new ideas generated?

## Description
Instead of a timelimit, push for as many solutions as possible. If the delegates give up after 50 solutions, demand another 50. Then demand another 25 once they reach 100.
