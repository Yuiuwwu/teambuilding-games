# One foot in the circle

## Description
The Chair forms a small circle or square with a rope on the ground, a piece of newspaper or cloth. You are allowed to stand on one foot only and the task is for everybody to stand in the circle.

## Description
There are plenty of ways to make this harder. Every time the group succeeds you can cut the area in half, you might only allow a certain number of feet on the ground and have them hold their position for 60 seconds.
