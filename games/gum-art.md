# Gum Art

## Description
Give each participant a piece of bubble gum to chew, toothpick and index card.
Allow them 10 minutes to chew the gum, place gum on index card and then design something on index card using only the toothpick as a tool (No Hands). The person with the best and most creative design is the winner. If you have quite a few players you can have several categories of winners, like "most ingenious" "most creative" and of course the "What is that?" award.

## Description
If you give each person more gum - try 3D sculptures
