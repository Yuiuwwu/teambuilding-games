# Water Bomb

## Description
Fill a bucket with water and place it in a circle (e.g. rope). The aim of this task is to get the bucket out of the circle. You may want to give them additional equipment (rope, a stick, ballons etc) No member of the group is allowed to step into the circle. The bucket may not fall over. The group should make a plan of what to do first and then try to do it in a set amount of time.

## Description
You can impose more or less drastic timelimits, you could limit what participants are allowed to use (only their clothes, only their left hands..) or increase the diameter of the circle.
