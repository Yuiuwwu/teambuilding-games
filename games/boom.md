# Boom!

## Description
Participants stand or sit in a circle. Instruct them to count out loud consecutively and around the circle. Each delegate whose number is a multiple of 3 (3-6-9-12, etc.) or a number that ends with 3 (13-23-33, etc.) must lift their arms and say "BOOM!" instead of the number. The next person continues the normal sequence of numbers.

Anyone who fails to say "BOOM!" or makes a mistake with the number that
follows "BOOM!" is disqualified. To make things even more difficult, reverse from e.g. 30.
