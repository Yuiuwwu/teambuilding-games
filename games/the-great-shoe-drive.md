# The Great Shoe Drive

## Description
This game works best with lots and lots of players, at least 30-40. Get everyone
to take off their left shoe. Put all the shoes in a pile. At "Go!", everyone dives for the pile and grabs a shoe, any shoe. The object of the game is then for each player to find the person who has their shoe and reclaim it!
