# Grand Prix

## Description
The group should be sitting in a circle. Number them 1-4 and give each number the name of a car (for example 1’s are Porsches, 2’s are Ferrari’s... etc.).

The group leader calls a car name and those cars have to get up and run around the
circle. The first person back to their spot wins. There is a twist to this game: the cars can have things wrong with them as the group leader chooses.

Some ideas are: FLAT TIRE (Hop around on one foot), RUN OUT OF GAS
(Crab Walk), TURBO BOOST (run around), NO MUFFLER (noisy!)...etc.
