# There ain't no flies on me

## Description
The group should be divided in two parts and placed on each short side of a rectangular plane. The first group starts and takes one step towards the centre of the plane, saying "There aint no flies on me". They take another two steps and finish the third step by saying "But there are some flies on you". The other group does the same. When they have taken their third step and the two groups are facing each other - the first group says "Kaboom". The task is now for each group to bring the other groups members to their side. Once brought to the other side you become a member of the new group. Only one team will win.
