# Paper Bag Skits

## Description
First split your group into teams consisting of three to six members. Give each
team a paper bag filled with assorted objects. These can be almost anything, i.e. a wooden spoon, a screw, a bar of soap, a computer disk, etc... The aim of the game is to present a skit using all of the props provided. The props may be used as they would be in normal life, or they may be imaginatively employed. Give each group a topic to base their skit on. When all the skits have been planned and rehearsed they are performed for the amusement of all.
