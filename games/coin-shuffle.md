# Coin Shuffle

## Description
You will need a largeish coin (\"loonies\" or \"twonies\" work well) and a paper\ntarget for each team. Divide your group into teams and have them line up at one end of your playing area. Place a paper bullseye target or other receptacle at the other end of the playing area. At \"go\", the first girl in each line takes the coin, wedges it between her bum cheeks - if this is inappropriate hold it between her feet - not under her shoe, and shuffles as fast as she can to the target! When she arrives, she has to drop the coin onto the target, aiming for the center! You can have someone to keep score if you like.
