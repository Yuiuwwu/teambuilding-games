# Ball in Group

## Description
Using this as a name game helps. Start by getting them to throw the ball to someone in the group - no one can receive the ball twice. Once each member of the group has received the ball repeat in backwards order (i.e. throw it to the person who threw it to you) see if they can go forwards again and add timings - try and get them to do it in the shortest time possible.

## Description
One handed - makes game harder
Eyes closed - makes game harder
