## Description
The chair/trainer performs a random action (e.g.: pulling their thumb). Then s/he shouts 'next and performs another action. At the shout, people have to perform the previous action (in this case, pulling their thumbs) while looking at the chair/trainer performing the new one. And so on.

## Description
Can work in a chain - so the person performing the random action only does it to the person on their right. This is passed on to the right, but each time it's passed on the original person has to come up with a new move. This gets passed to the right etc. etc.This helps with concentration and multi-tasking.
