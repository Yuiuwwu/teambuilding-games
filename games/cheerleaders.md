# Cheerleaders

## Description
Group is standing. Everyone begins milling around playing rock/paper/scissors. If someone loses a match, you must become a cheerleader for their victor. The cheerleaders shout and dance and support their victor in their next games. Players can gather more and more cheerleaders as the game goes on. When both players have Cheerleaders, the winner takes all.

The final round has a dance off between the cheerleaders before the two remaining players duel for victory. Music is preferred for this game.
