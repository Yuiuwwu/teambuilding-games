# Sheep and Shepherd

## Description
The group is told, that they will be blindfolded except one person who will act as a \"shepherd\" and guide them to their pen (their \"home\"). Try to give very little information the first time and only explain more if the specifically ask!\n\nGive them a couple of minutes to devise a strategy. Then blindfold them and randomly choose one person as the shepherd. Spin and position every single blindfolded person, maybe even move the sheep pen. Tell them that they (including the shepherd) are not allowed to talk at all.\n\nIf they fail, try again: The group members will have to invent an "acoustic" language (clapping, snapping fingers, etc- i.e., not talking), with which they are able to communicate direction and with which every member can be identified by their own "acoustic name".\n\nAllow time to let them solve the problem.
