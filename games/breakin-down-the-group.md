# Breakin' Down the Group

## Description
Ask the group to think of a number between 1 and 10. 
Ask the people whose number is even to get onto one side and the odds to get onto the other. Have the group from a circle. Split the circle in half by arbitrarily dividing the circle along the diameter. Try to get an equal number of people in each group. Have those groups form a circle. Divide these two circles by the same method to get four, approximately equal groups. (the only reason for going through the 1-10 portion is to get pairs and small groups of people who tend to "stick together" no matter what. We want to show these people it is really great to get to know other folks. Also, use associations to break up the group and form smaller groups or dyads.
