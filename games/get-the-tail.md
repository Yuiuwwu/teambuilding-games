# Get the Tail

## Description
All members of the group have a blindfold as their tail (stick the blindfold in the belt). The winner is the person who can take as many of the other peoples' tails without losing his/her own.

## Description
Alternative way to play the game:
Split the group into two teams, or play this game with another group. All members of each team form a line by holding hands. The first one is the head, the last one has the tail, a blindfold hanging at his/her back. The teams have to get the other's tail by running around and defending their own. The winner is the team that gets the other tail first.
