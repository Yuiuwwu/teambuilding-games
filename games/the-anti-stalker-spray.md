# The anti-stalker spray

## Description
The chair/trainer tells everyone the names of two other persons among the group: the first one will be the stalker, the second one the shed. Every participant is to keep the assigned names secret. The game area should be clearly delimited and wide enough to let people run safely. \n\nAs the chair/trainer say 'go, people have to move so that their spray stands between them and their stalker, the closer the possible to a straight line.\n\nAs the chair/trainer say 'stop, whoever is not adequately defended by their spray is eliminated.
