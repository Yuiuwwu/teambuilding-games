# Blind Search

## Description
Pick out approximately 5 objects that the group members can look at/touch. Send them out of the room and blindfold them. When they come back the objects are hidden in the room and the group has to work together to find them. They have 5 minutes. Define quite a small area to hide the objects in.

## Description
You can have one member of the group who has no blindfold and is the only one who can speak. He/she then needs to guide them towards the objects. In this case the objects should be hidden in a more difficult spot! This emphasises the need for clear explanations of the point that you're trying to put across to the group.
