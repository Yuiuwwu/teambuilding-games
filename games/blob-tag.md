# Blob Tag

## Description
One participant becomes "the blob" and a game of Tag begins. Once someone is tagged they become part of the blob as well by linking arms with the blob. The blob continues to grow until it has swallowed all team members.

It is a good idea to limit the area involved otherwise it becomes impossible to catch everyone.
