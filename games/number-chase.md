# Number Chase

## Description
Everyone will be in an open space with set outer limits. Every person has a number. One person will start off and be the "Chaser".

The Chaser will try to catch any other person and thereby make that person the Chaser. However, at any time, anyone can call out a number and make that person
the Chaser. Soon, no one will know who the Chaser is and everyone will just be running about the place frantically!

To finish (or to begin) you can do the "eyes-closed, count to 20" or
whatever number you like.
