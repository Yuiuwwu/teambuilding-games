# I like people who...

## Description
Everyone needs a place-marker to stand on (tape / chalk mark) - places are marked in a circle. One participant is in the middle, her spot is removed. She calls out "I like people who . . ." Suggestions:
- like camping
- eat cereal for breakfast
- love brownies

Anyone who falls into that category must change places with another person in the circle to whom the statement applies. The participant in the middle tries to get a spot also and the person who is left in the middle makes the next statement. 
Particpants may not take a space next to them.
