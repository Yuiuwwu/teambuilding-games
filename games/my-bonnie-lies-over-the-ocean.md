# My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean

## Description
Purpose of this activity is to energize your participants and help them listen to 
their inner voice - they need to listen to the sounds in the song, not follow their peers. 

Procedure:  
Participants get into a circle, standing shoulder to shoulder, facing in. 
Participants count off in "ones" and "twos". 
Ones start game bending over touching their knees. 
Twos start game standing up. 
As students sing the song "My Bonnie", the "ones" and "two" change 
positions every time they hear the "B" sound. So the first "B" sound, the 
"Ones" stand up and the "Twos" touch their knees. 
Hold these positions until the next "B" sound, and change. 
Start out slow. But increase the tempo for each round. 

Song: 
My Bonnie lies over the ocean. 
My Bonnie lies over the sea. 
My Bonnie lies over the ocean. 
So bring back my Bonnie to me. 
Bring back, bring back, 
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me, to me. 
Bring back, bring back, 
Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
