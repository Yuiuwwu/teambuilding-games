# My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean

## Description
Purpose of this activity is to energize your participants and help them listen to \ntheir inner voice - they need to listen to the sounds in the song, not follow their peers. \n\nProcedure:  \nParticipants get into a circle, standing shoulder to shoulder, facing in. \nParticipants count off in \"ones\" and \"twos\". \nOnes start game bending over touching their knees. \nTwos start game standing up. \nAs students sing the song \"My Bonnie\", the \"ones\" and \"two\" change \npositions every time they hear the \"B\" sound. So the first \"B\" sound, the \n\"Ones\" stand up and the \"Twos\" touch their knees. \nHold these positions until the next \"B\" sound, and change. \nStart out slow. But increase the tempo for each round. \n\nSong: \nMy Bonnie lies over the ocean. \nMy Bonnie lies over the sea. \nMy Bonnie lies over the ocean. \nSo bring back my Bonnie to me. \nBring back, bring back, \nOh, bring back my Bonnie to me, to me. \nBring back, bring back, \nOh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
