# Alien

## Description
An Alien is amongst us ! You can't see it but it likes to suck itself onto peoples
face ! Very extremely dangerous of course ! So when the alien is on you, you have to use all your strength to get rid of it. Pull it with both hands from your face, and throw it away in someone else's direction. Now the next person has the problem!
