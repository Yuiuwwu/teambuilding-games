# Sticky Toffee

## Description
1 or 2 players (depending on the size of the game) need to stand out while all the others tie themselves up (usually seated on the ground) as tightly as possible with arms, legs, necks, bodies anything really. Once they are tightly bound in a lump of humans the players standing outside the circle need to get people out of the lump. As you're drawn out the "toffee" lump you have to help the people outside get people out. The winners are the two left inside the toffee - they are the stickiest.

## Description
Blindfolds would be a very exciting twist for those inside or outside the circle - makes the game more interesting and much more difficult
