# Please Spare Me Baby

## Description
Everyone receives a balloon, to be placed under their shirt on the back side. The balloons have been previously filled in a way that they are not likely to explode under small pressure (that is, its still safe to grasp them and gently squeeze them).
 
As the chair/trainer says 'go, each person has to grab and hold another one from the back, so as to make their balloon explode.

The last one carrying their balloon wins.
