# Jig Saw

## Description
As each delegate enters the room, give them a piece of a puzzle. (These should be simple puzzles with a relatively small number of pieces.) The delegates must cooperate with the other members to find out which puzzle they belong to and where their pieces fit. This will help the participants work together to accomplish a task.
