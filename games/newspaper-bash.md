# Newspaper Bash

## Description
Everyone stands in a circle. One person goes in the middle and holds a newspaper (or something similar). One of the people in the circle calls out a name. The person in the middle now has to hit the person whose name was called out on the shoulder. However, if the person whose name was called out shouts out another name, the person in the middle has to hit that person. If at any point the person in the middle succeeds, he/she switched with the person that got hit.

## Description
SITTING DOWN:
Everyone sits in a circle, with their legs in towards the centre. One person is
designated to start in the middle. The person in the middle is given a rolled-up
newspaper or any other harmless "basher". A name is called to start the game,
usually by the leader, or a designated person. The toe-basher must then hit the
person whos name has been called, before this person calls a new name. This
recently named person must then name another person, and so on, until the
toe-basher succeeds in hitting someone's feet before they can call someone
else's name. Then the two switch places. The person who was in the middle
must call out a name before sitting down again, or they can be "bashed" by the
new person in the middle. And the game continues. If the name of the person in
the middle is called, the person who called it must take his place.
The game can last up to half an hour, depending on the group size and
dynamics... but can be stopped at any time.
