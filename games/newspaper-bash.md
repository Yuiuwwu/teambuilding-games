# Newspaper Bash

## Description
Everyone stands in a circle. One person goes in the middle and holds a newspaper (or something similar). One of the people in the circle calls out a name. The person in the middle now has to hit the person whose name was called out on the shoulder. However, if the person whose name was called out shouts out another name, the person in the middle has to hit that person. If at any point the person in the middle succeeds, he/she switched with the person that got hit.

## Description
SITTING DOWN:\nEveryone sits in a circle, with their legs in towards the centre. One person is\ndesignated to start in the middle. The person in the middle is given a rolled-up\nnewspaper or any other harmless \"basher\". A name is called to start the game,\nusually by the leader, or a designated person. The toe-basher must then hit the\nperson whos name has been called, before this person calls a new name. This\nrecently named person must then name another person, and so on, until the\ntoe-basher succeeds in hitting someone's feet before they can call someone\nelse's name. Then the two switch places. The person who was in the middle\nmust call out a name before sitting down again, or they can be \"bashed\" by the\nnew person in the middle. And the game continues. If the name of the person in\nthe middle is called, the person who called it must take his place.\nThe game can last up to half an hour, depending on the group size and\ndynamics... but can be stopped at any time.
