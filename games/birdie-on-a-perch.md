# Birdie on a Perch

## Description
Form a circle with your group. Number them ones and twos. Have the twos take a step forward and turn around and face someone on the outside circle so there are 2 circles facing each other. The inside circle is where the Birdies are and the outside circle are the Perches and the person opposite you is your Perch or Birdie.

To perch, the Birdie must use their Perch (e.g. be lifted up/climb them) to avoid any contact with the ground. The group leader will provide music and as the music plays the two circles rotate in opposite directions. The group leader yells "Birdie on a Perch!" at random and the birdies must scramble to find their perches. The last couple to successfully perch is out until a single couple is left.
