# City Game

## Description
Hand each person a paper with two cities on it (prepared in advance), for
example: Denver and Kyiv (it may be the name of the city where the meeting takes place). Every person would have one different name, but they would all have one in common. They are not allowed telling anyone what's on their paper.
￼￼￼
￼Gather them into a circle and make hold hands. Tells them a story mentioning every single city name. The person who has Denver has to try to sit down and make their bum touch the floor (or, for example, touch the floor with both hands). The other people have to hold them up. In the end, the one common city name is called out and everyone drops to the floor.
