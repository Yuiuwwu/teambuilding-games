# Ball in order

## Description
The group stands in a circle. The group is told that they now have to throw a ball around the circle and every member must have had the ball once before it goes back to the first person. After the first round they have to throw the SAME combination again. Then Then as quick as possible. Then backwards. And quicker... (Can they manage in 2 seconds?)
