# Traffic Jam

## Description
The group is split into 2 equal subgroups. The 2 subgroups take their position facing each other with the empty space in the middle.

Starting formation: xxxxxx oooooo Finishing formation: oooooo xxxxxx

The purpose of the exercise is for the 2 groups to swap ends of the matrix without making any illegal moves. Legal Moves:

1. A person can step forward to an empty space directly in front of them.
2. A person can move forward to an empty space passing only one player going in the opposite direction. 3. No person can move backwards

## Description
It's already quite difficult

Planning time with no practice (just discussion) - makes it easier
No reexplanation of the rules - makes it harder
