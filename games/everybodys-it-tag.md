# Everybody's It Tag

## Description
Make sure everyone is comfortable with either running or fast walking. Decide with participants on the size of the playing field. The game starts with everyone being "it" and trying to tag whoever they can. If tagged, the victim must kneel down where they were tagged. When kneeling, they need to keep track of who tagged them because once the person who tagged is in turn tagged, then the victim can get back up and get back in the game.

The game ends when there are only a few people left who haven't been tagged.
