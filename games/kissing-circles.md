# Kissing Circles

## Description
Two circles are formed, smaller one in the middle. Circles start moving in opposite directions with delegates skipping to the song.

Singing:
"Come with me and play, hey! Come with me today, hey!
Come with me and play today 'till we yell hooray!
Let me face you and give you a kiss, tarara.
This is something you dont want to miss.
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, kiss"

When the music stops, the circles also stop, the smaller circle turns to face the outer circle and each person must kiss the person to thier opposite on the cheek. The kissed ones get into the middle and form another circle.
