# Two Truths, One Lie

## Description
Each person has to tell two truths about him/herself and one lie, while the others try to guess which is the lie. The key is to make the truths as outrageous as the lies so they are believable. Can also be played in pairs, where one has to present their partner with two truths and one lie.

## Description
Variation: Each delegate is asked three questions by the rest of the committee. Two questions must be answered truthfully, and one response must be a lie.
