# Draw Your Life

## Description
Explain to participants that they have 5-10 minutes to draw a scene out of their normal day at school, university or at work. Encourage delegates to get creative and use colours in their drawings.

Collect the flipchart sheets when finished and distribute them randomly between participants so that everyone has a sheet. Ask for volunteers to stick their given sheets on the board or wall. The group tries to interpret and explain the drawing on it.
Once their explanation has finished, you can ask the drawer of the image to clarify what the drawing means.
