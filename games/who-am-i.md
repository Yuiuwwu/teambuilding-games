# Who am I?

## Description
The facilitator prepares one piece of paper per member of the group with a name of a famous person. Each participant receives one piece and, without looking at it, tapes it on their forehead.\n\nNow everybody mingles and has to find out who he/she is by asking the others with simple questions. One may only answer questions with yes or no.\n\nOnce a participant has found their person, they take off their paper, but may continue to help others with their famous people.

## Description
Each member of the group prepares one paper. The papers are mixed by the facilitator and handed out to the group members. \nSaves preparation.\n\nIf facilitator prepares the papers, he can create pairs which then have to find each other. The game can then be simplified by allowing participants to make signs / gestures that are connected to each other (famous couples,...) and to find their partners.
