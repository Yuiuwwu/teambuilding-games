# Water Trays

## Description
Split the group into 2 or more teams.

Each team is provided with one or more canteen trays filled with water, and are assigned one large container situated at the end of a racing track.The aim of the game is to carry the water to that bucket whilst spilling as little as possible.

To do so, each tray has to be carried by at least two people at once. The first two players fill the tray with water and run off. Once they reach the bucket, they tip the water into it and then run back to the rest of the team to hand the tray to the next two people.

## Description
Use buckets, cups, glasses or any other container: will make the game easier.

Add obstacles on the track: makes it nearly impossible to carry more than tiny amounts of water.

Blindfold one of the players carrying the tray: adds a trust dimension, makes game harder.

Blindfold both players carrying the tray and have a third one give directions: cooperation, communication, makes game harder. Adds a trust dimension and importance of clear communication and giving directions.
