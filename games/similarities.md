# Similarities

## Description
Participants sit in a circle on chairs. Everybody has a chair except one person in the middle. He really wants to sit ! So this person names a fact such as\n\"I have black trousers\", \"I live in Amsterdam\", \"I have a sister\", or even \"I have two eyes\". \nAll people who can say that too have to change seats, the rest stays seated. The person who was in the middle will try to sit on one of the chairs, and one person remains. This person now asks the next question.
