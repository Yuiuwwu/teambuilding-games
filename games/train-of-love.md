# Train of Love

## Description
As the name suggests, this song is quite physical. Form a circle. Everyone puts their hands on the hips of the person in front of them. Everyone walks forward while singing:

We're all in the train of love! Aaaah. (2x)
We're all in the train of phantasy
We're all in the train of love. Aaaah.

On "Aaaah." the train stops and everyone stretches their arms to the sides. Now comes the more active part:

When I say Chicka!
When I say Chacka!
When I say Chicka, Chicka, Chicka, Chicka, Chacka!
When I say Chacka!
When I say Chicka!
When I say Chacka, Chacka, Chacka, Chacka, Chicka!

On every "Chicka!" everyone jumps forward a bit with both feet, on every "Chacka!" everyone jumps back a bit.

Now, everyone reaches forward and holds the hips of the person in front of the person in front of them. Repeat twice, then try to have everyone sit down on the lap of the person behind them and continue until the train derails.
