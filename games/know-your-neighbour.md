# Know your neighbour

## Description
One participant is designated to be IT. He takes his place in the centre of the
participants, sitting in a circle in the dark (the game can also be played in the light). 

IT suddenly flashes his flashlight on one of the players and asks "Who are your next door neighbours?" And then he flashes the light on the nearby neighbours. 

If the player who was asked the question can't name both neighbours correctly, he becomes IT. If he does name them correctly, IT asks him "How is So and So?", naming either of the player. If the reply is "OK", the players remain seated, but if the answer is "Not so good", all players must change seats. While everyone is shifting IT tries to get a seat. If he succeeds the one without a spot then becomes IT. 

Note: Until everyone is sure of the names, IT must give them time to learn the names of their neighbours before they shift.
