# Ikea Game

## Description
Split the group into three groups. Each group has 2 builders, 1 or 2 runners, and 1 looker. In one location, you have arranged the objects in a certain set up. All the other groups have their own set of objects in a different location. In the middle there is a meeting point. First, the looker goes to the location where you have arranged the objects in a certain set up. He/she then moves to the middle, meets the runner(s), and explains what he she has observed. The runner(s) then go to the builders. The builders can only ask yes/no questions to the runner. When the runner wants to find out more information, he/she goes back to meet the looker. The game ends when all groups feel they are more or less done, and then the results are compared.
