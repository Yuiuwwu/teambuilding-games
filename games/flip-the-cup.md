# Flip the Cup

## Description
Delegates are divided into two teams. Both teams stand on one side of a table. On the table are cups - enough for everyone - filled with water. The person on the right (on both sides of the table) start by drinking the water as soon as possible. When they are done, they have to put their cup back on the table and flip it. When they have succeeded, the person standing next to them does the same thing. The team that finishes first, wins.\n\nThe aim of this game is not only to have fun, but also to hydrate. This sounds funny, but in some circumstances you really have to make sure that your delegates drink enough water.
