# Warm Fuzzies

## Description
Cut squares of paper. Brainstorm a list of positive characteristics about other people (for example: kind, cheerful, considerate, fun, sincere, friendly, humorous, responsible, warm, empathic, loyal, unselfish). Invite participants to choose one positive characteristic from the list that best describes each person in the group. Participants write the name of the person on a post it and add the positive characteristic they find most fitting. When everyone is finished, hand the squares to the persons they belong to. Each person can place their squares in an envelope and enjoy their \"warm fuzzies\".
