# Move it buddy

## Description
Stand in a circle, with one person in the middle. When the person in the middle
says so, participants will be given 30 seconds to one minute to memorize the
first, middle, and last name of the person to their left and right. After the minute is over, the person in the middle will point to somebody and say "left" or
"right". If he or she pauses or stumbles saying the full name, he or she is then in
the middle. If everyone seems to know each others names right away, the
person in the middle can call out, "Move It Buddy!" and everyone must rush to a
new space and begin memorizing names again.
