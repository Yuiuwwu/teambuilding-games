# Pigonality Profile

## Description
Instructions: "On a blank piece of paper, draw a pig. Dont look at your neighbors pig. Dont even glance." No further guidance and no explanation about the purpose of the exercise. When participants are finished, explanation that the pig serves as a useful test of the personality traits of the artist. If the pig is drawn:
 Toward the top of the paper, you are a positive, optimistic person,
 Toward the middle of the page (top to bottom), you are a realist,
 Toward the bottom of the page, you are pessimistic and have a tendency to behave negatively,
 Facing left, you believe in tradition, are friendly, and remember dates, including birthdays,
 Facing forward (looking toward you), you are direct, enjoy playing devils advocate, and neither fear nor avoid discussions,
 Facing right, you are innovative and active but dont have a strong sense of family, nor do you remember dates,
 With many details, you are analytical, cautious, and distrustful,
 With few details, you are emotional and naive; you care little for details and are a risk -taker,
 With less than four legs showing, you are insecure or are living through a period of major change; with four legs showing, you are secure, stubborn, and stick to your ideals.
 Further the size of the pigs ears indicates how good a listener the artist is - large is good. And the length of the pigs tail - again, more is better - indicates the quality of the artists sex life.
