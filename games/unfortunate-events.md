# Unfortunate Events

## Description
Divide the group into two teams with two flipcharts per team. Ask groups to write down in 5 minutes 3 sentences that describe a negative situation.
For example, "My car broke down this morning on my way to work". Ask the groups to stick their flipcharts to the wall. 

Now, ask the groups to must find as many positive points as possible about the negative situations on both flipcharts. Each group should work on its own in a competitive fashion. Ask them to record their positive remarks on another flipchart. The team that comes up with the most number of positive points in 5 minutes wins.

## Description
1. Groups exchange negative situations and other group has to find positive points. 
2. Make the exercise non-competitive.
