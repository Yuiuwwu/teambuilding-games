# Big Fat Pony

## Description
Form a circle. One person starts and goes around the inside of the circle in a gallop (or canter) like a slightly overweight horse. Everyone cheers him on with singing:

Here we go with the big fat pony (3x)
Early in the morning

At this point, the pony stops and does a shaky dance with the person in front of him/her:

Front to front to front, my baby
Back to back to back, my baby
Side to side to side, my baby
Early in the morning

This person then joins the first pony and they continue to go around in the circle until everyone is trained to behave like a proper big fat pony.
