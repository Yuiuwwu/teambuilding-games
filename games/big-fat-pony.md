# Big Fat Pony

## Description
Form a circle. One person starts and goes around the inside of the circle in a gallop (or canter) like a slightly overweight horse. Everyone cheers him on with singing:\n\nHere we go with the big fat pony (3x)\nEarly in the morning\n\nAt this point, the pony stops and does a shaky dance with the person in front of him/her:\n\nFront to front to front, my baby\nBack to back to back, my baby\nSide to side to side, my baby\nEarly in the morning\n\nThis person then joins the first pony and they continue to go around in the circle until everyone is trained to behave like a proper big fat pony.
