# Plane Wreck

## Description
Your committee is presented with this scenario: the people in the group were on a plan when it crashed in the desert. The plane is on fire and will soon explode. They must determine which five items they will retrieve from the plane to help them survive in the desert.\nThe items available are:\n life vest\n 2-way radio\n picture of Chairman Mao\n crate of army rations\n book of matches\n flashlight with batteries\n case of three emergency flares\n mirror\n map of surrounding area\n sextant\n compass\n water purification tablets\nThe individuals are to choose the five items that they wish to save. At this point they are not to discuss their choices with the other group members. Then, give five minutes to talk as a group to reach consensus. After the second period, the place explodes.\nTalk about how choices were made. Was voting necessary? Did everyone agree at the beginning? How were tough decisions made? Did any compromising take place?
