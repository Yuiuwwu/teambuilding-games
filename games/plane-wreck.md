# Plane Wreck

## Description
Your committee is presented with this scenario: the people in the group were on a plan when it crashed in the desert. The plane is on fire and will soon explode. They must determine which five items they will retrieve from the plane to help them survive in the desert.
The items available are:
 life vest
 2-way radio
 picture of Chairman Mao
 crate of army rations
 book of matches
 flashlight with batteries
 case of three emergency flares
 mirror
 map of surrounding area
 sextant
 compass
 water purification tablets
The individuals are to choose the five items that they wish to save. At this point they are not to discuss their choices with the other group members. Then, give five minutes to talk as a group to reach consensus. After the second period, the place explodes.
Talk about how choices were made. Was voting necessary? Did everyone agree at the beginning? How were tough decisions made? Did any compromising take place?
