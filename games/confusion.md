# Confusion

## Description
Give each participant a sheet with various tasks and ask them to complete it  when you say, "GO!" 

For example:
- Get a boy to do five push-ups and sign here.
- Leap frog over someone 5 times.
- Get someone to whisper the pledge of allegiance and sign here.
- Play "Ring around the Rosy" with two other people and have them sign here.
- Get a girl to recite a nursery rhyme.
- Shake hands with someone you do not know and continue holding hands while debating the merits of your favorite ice cream flavour.
- Have someone teach you a dance step (even if they make it up).

First person to complete the entire sheet, wins.
