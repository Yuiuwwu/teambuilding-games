# Murdery Mystery

## Description
The players sit in a circle facing inwards. One player, the detective is taken away where he can not see or hear the others. One of the players in the circle is designated as the murderer. The players are told a secret signal (e.g. a hand signal). The detective is then returned to the circle where he must guess the identity of the murderer before he kills everyone. If any of the players notes the signal coming from the murderer he must 'die in some dramatic fashion. The detective only has a limited number of guesses in which to guess the identity of the murderer (by pointing at them). If the detective fails to guess in time, the murderer takes his place and play continues anew. 3 guesses is a sensible number for most groups.
