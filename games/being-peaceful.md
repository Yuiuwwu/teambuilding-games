# Being Peaceful

## Description
On small pieces of paper, participants write down some of the things that makes people angry or sad. These might be: ruining their favorite dress, losing a favorite book or game, or someone yells at them at work or at school. 

Collect the pieces of paper and put them in a bag. Ask everyone to sit in a circle. Each player takes a turn to pull a slip from the bag and reads it, then tears it into small peaces. When everyone is finished, all say together: "I am a peaceful being. I act in ways that are peaceful. I care about others and myself. I am a happy being."
