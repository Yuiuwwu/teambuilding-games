# Giants, Wizards and Dwarfs

## Description
This is a team approach to the ancient game of rock, paper, and scissors.

The key to the game is this: Wizards cast spells on giants: "Shazam!" Giants squish dwarfs: "Huaarrg!" Dwarfs are small and quick and outsmart wizards: "Miniminimini!" The game begins with teams huddling together, deciding which creatures the team will be. The entire team must be the same creature at the same time. As soon as the teams have decided on their creature, they line up face to face with the opposing team, in rows about four feet apart. On the leaders command team members jump to their pose. A point is scored on the basis of which creature beats which. If both teams form the same creature, no point is scored and teams return to their huddle to decide their next team move. The first team to score 5-7 points wins.
