# Group Massage

## Description
The group forms a circle. The members in the circle all face one way (either left or right) so that each is looking at the back of the person "in front" of him/her. Everyone then massages the shoulders of the person in front of him/her. Talking is
encouraged. Have the group members turn 180 degrees and give a massage to the person who first gave the massage.
