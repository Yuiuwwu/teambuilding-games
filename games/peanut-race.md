# Peanut Race

## Description
Make duos. Make two lines on the floor, circa 10 metres apart. One member of every duo stands on either one of the sides.
Everyone on one side of the line gets a peanut and has to roll this by using their noses to the other side, where their partner stands. When the peanut has crossed the line, the other part of the duo has to roll it back to the other line. 

The duo that is the fastest in doing so wins.
