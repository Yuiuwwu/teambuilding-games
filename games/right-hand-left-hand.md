# Right Hand, Left Hand

## Description
￼Write all the letters of the alphabet clearly on the board with the following underneath each letter

L, L, R, L, B, L, B, L, L, R, R, R, L, B, L, B, L ,R, R, B, B, B, R, L, B, L

As you all read through the alphabet, they're to put their hand up according to the instruction below the letter. R = right arm, L = left arm and B = both arms.
Finish the alphabet slowly.
This is fairly easy so do it again in half the time.
Next do it backwards.
Finish by asking whether everyone is warmed up and how do their arms feel.
￼
You'll find when doing public speaking immediately afterwards you are more inclined to gesture freely, which is encouraged.
