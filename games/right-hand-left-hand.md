# Right Hand, Left Hand

## Description
￼Write all the letters of the alphabet clearly on the board with the following underneath each letter\n\nL, L, R, L, B, L, B, L, L, R, R, R, L, B, L, B, L ,R, R, B, B, B, R, L, B, L\n\nAs you all read through the alphabet, they're to put their hand up according to the instruction below the letter. R = right arm, L = left arm and B = both arms.\nFinish the alphabet slowly.\nThis is fairly easy so do it again in half the time.\nNext do it backwards.\nFinish by asking whether everyone is warmed up and how do their arms feel.\n￼\nYou'll find when doing public speaking immediately afterwards you are more inclined to gesture freely, which is encouraged.
