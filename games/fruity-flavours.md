# Fruity Flavours

## Description
Participants pick a unique fruit of their liking. In larger groups let everyone have a small sign in front of him, stating his or her fruit of choice but remove them once they know the game.\nParticipants clap in rhythmic motion - two claps on the lap and twice snapping their fingers, one with their right hand, one with their left hand.\nThe goal is to pass the rhythm by naming on the first 'snap your own fruit, on the second 'snap the fruit of another participant and react on time.\nExample: x = clapping lap \nDelegate Apple: x x Apple Pear\nDelegate Pear: x x Pear Orange\nDelegate Orange: x x Orange Pear etc.\n\nCan be played with anything replacing fruits, for example animals.
