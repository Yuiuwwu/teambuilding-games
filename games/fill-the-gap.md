# Fill The Gap

## Description
The players except for one stand in a large circle. One player walks around the circle and touches a player on the shoulder. Then both of these players must run around the circle in the opposite direction in order to reach the gap in the circle. He/she must then walk around the outside of the circle and touch someone else.

## Description
Having more than two players makes the game more exciting, but also hard to keep track which are the correct gaps and who is currently tagging.
