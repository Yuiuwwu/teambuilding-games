# Pass the Orange

## Description
The group stands in a circle. One person squeezes the ball (or orange) between chin and neck. Now the ball has to be transported around the circle, from one person to the next, without using hands and without the ball falling to the ground.

## Description
Pass the Bottle: Use a bottle instead that you pass between your knees, makes the game harder. Combine bottle and ball for maximum effect!
