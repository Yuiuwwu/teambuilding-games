# Blind Band

## Description
Participants lay on their backs on the floor with eyes closed. Do not introduce the game beforehand; just explain what you expect of them as you go.

Let them relax for a moment and then run them through some breathe-in-breathe-out sequences. Explain to them that they are blind musicians, and that by tapping them they start or stop playing.

Walk through the room and start tapping people 'on and 'off. Once you get to the point where people are tapped 'on for a second time, tell them they are not allowed to do the same sound or beat again, and that they have to be more creative.
Try to keep one participant with a good beatbox / rhythm 'on for most of the time as it will help the others. 

The aim is for all participants to produce one synchronized rhythm. Remember that at all times they need to have their eyes closed so they can lose some of their inhibitions towards making weird noises.

End the game by shutting them all up at the same time.
