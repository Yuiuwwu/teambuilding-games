# Bear Eats the Pear

## Description
A tennis ball is needed for this game. The game is a cross between 'Kiss the rabbit and 'Pass the orange. Every member of the team is a bear. In the beginning of the game each member is asked where his mouth is. It could be between knees, on shoulder, in pocket etc. After that the pear - the tennis ball - is introduced. 

Each bear has to feed it to the bear on their right mouth to mouth, mouth being the body part they had previously chosen. The game ends when participants have made a full circle not dropping the ball. The game can be timed.
