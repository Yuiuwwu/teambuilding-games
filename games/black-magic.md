# Black Magic

## Description
You need two people who know this game. One of them (person A) leaves the
room while the rest of the group including second person knowing the game (person B) decides what object B will have to guess. When A returns B starts pointing to some object asking "is this it?, is that it?". A countinuously says no until B points to an object that is black. The NEXT object is the one that A needs to identify. When it is pointed to, A says: "yes that's the object the group picked". Play the game till someone figures out how it is done.

Or tell 2 people exactly how it works

## Description
Can go on for days - particularly if the people who don't figure it out aren't told the rule.
