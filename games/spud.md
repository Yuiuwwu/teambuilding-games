# SPUD

## Description
All you need for this game is a bean bag. Gather everyone in a standing circle, close enough that everyone touches elbows. Pick someone to stand in the centre of the circle with the bean bag. This person then throws the bean bag up into the air and calls out someone's name. Everyone scatters as far and as fast as they can, except the person whose name has been called: he/she grabs the bean bag. Once he/she has the bag, that person yells "Freeze!" and everyone freezes in their tracks. The person with the bean bag then picks someone to be the "target". You are allowed to take as many steps toward the target as there are letters in the target's name, spelling the target's name as it goes (don't worry too much about misspellings). Once the person has taken as many steps as is allowed, throw the bean bag at the target. If the throw hits the intended target, that person picks up a letter "S". This person then becomes the next to stand in the centre of the circle and toss the bag up in the air. The game continues until someone has accumulated enough letters to spell the word "SPUD".
