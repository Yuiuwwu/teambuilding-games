# Blind Guidance

## Description
Each member is blindfolded. They form a queue with their hands on the person's shoulder standing in front of them. Only the first person is not blindfolded and guides the rest of the group. They can walk in the woods, or something with a lot of steps and obstacles to make it more complicated. Care should be taken to ensure that no one is hurt.

## Description
(requires a rope) Everyone puts on their blindfold. They form a row, and are given a rope in their hands. One person is allowed to see and must now lead the group over a certain distance.
