# Name and action

## Description
Make a standing circle. Have one person start by saying his/her name and an action. The action should start with the same letter of the name (Energetic Eric, Jumping Josephine). They tell the name and perform the action: so "Jumping Josephine" would jump up and how. Each one says his/her name and action and each subsequent person repeats the action and name of the people before and add his/her on. The last person has to repeat everything.
