# Chairs

## Description
The participants sit on chairs placed in a large circle.
The facilitator has a list of items she then reads out. 

If what the facilitator reads applies to a participant, he moves the appropriate number of seats clockwise.

Examples (facilitator can make up anything suitable):
- Anyone with a brother, move one seat clockwise.
- Anyone with a sister, move one seat counter-clockwise
- Anyone with black hair, move one seat clockwise.
- Anyone who has been to the USA, move two seats counter-clockwise.
- Anyone over the age of 21, move one seat counter clockwise.
- Anyone wearing brown shoes, move one seat clockwise.
- Anyone left-handed, move two seats clockwise.
- Any French speaker, move one seat counter-clockwise.
- Anyone afraid of any animal, move one seat clockwise.
- Anyone who been bunjee jumping, move three seats clockwise.
- Anyone who is or used to be a vegetarian, move one seat clockwise.
- Anyone who writes or used to write poetry, move one seat clockwise.

If a participant moves, but his neighbour doesn't, he sits on the other's lap. Multpile people can therefore occupy the same chair.

Make sure you have lots of categories so that everyone gets lots of chances to move.
