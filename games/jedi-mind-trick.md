# Jedi Mind Trick

## Description
Stand in a circle with one person in the middle. The goal of the person in the center is to take another participantâ€™s place in the circle.

Members of the outer circle attempt to switch places without losing a spot in the circle to the person in the middle. To switch places, a participant on the outside makes eye contact with another member of the circle and then both members run across the circle and switch places. No talking or additional gestures can be used.

Additional rule: You can make it so that you must switch with someone at least two spaces away, so as to prevent too much switching with the person next to them.
