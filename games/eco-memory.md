# Eco Memory

## Description
You need some leaves, stones or little sticks which are placed on a blanket or t-shirt and covered with a second blanket (or t- shirt). The group is now told that the objects will be uncovered and that they will have two minutes to memorise as many as possible. After the two minutes the objects are recovered and the group must go and find as many similar objects as possible.
