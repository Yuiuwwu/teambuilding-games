# Come up with a game

## Description
A game more indicated for CJO teambuilding or more experienced groups. Can eventually be played with delegates if the group is particularly enthusiastic and creative.

Everybody stands in a circle. The char or facilitator throws an object in the middle of the circle.

The facilitator gives everyone a limited amount of time and tells them to come up with a new game/energiser with that object. Make them execute that energiser.

## Description
Everyone needs to come up with a new game: everyone contributes, more ideas.

Come up with as many new games as possible: less quality in the resulting games, but more dynamic, process becomes part of the energiser.

## Description
Hint: Have a notebook with you to note down the best ideas.
