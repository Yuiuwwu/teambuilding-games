# Essence Circle

## Description
This is great in the dark under a sky full of stars or at the end of a hard year of
organizing. Everyone sits in a circle and puts their name into the middle (a hat or box). The person that begins chooses a name to describe but does not say the name. He doesnt describe the persons appearance or clothes; he describes the persons essence. He talks about how this person (trying not to reveal gender) always helps make everyone feel better, is always willing to take the time to listen, etc. After a good description, people can say who they think it is. (Try to describe in enough detail that it really singles them out, or at least narrows it down to a few people.) Then the person they were describing describes the essence of another and so on until everyone has been described.

## Description
For officials teams, after each "Essence has been described" the person describing can make a toast to the person being described.
