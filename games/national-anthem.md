# National Anthem

## Description
The participants stand in a circle. The teambuilder puts on the source of music and participants dance and pass the ball around in the circle. Whenever the music stops, whoever has the ball in his/her hand must step into the circle and sing the first verse of his/her national anthem. If he/she cannot remember the national anthem (which happens sometimes) he/she must sing a love song to pass. 

After this has been done satisfactorily, the teambuilder turns on the music again and participants again pass the ball in the circle. The game continues until many participants have had the opportunity to sing or the trainer feels that everyone has been energized.
