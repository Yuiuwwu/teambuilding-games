# Better Letters

## Description
The group leader screams out a letter of the alphabet. The group members have to shout out English words starting with that letter. Once the group as a whole has warmed up, move on to individuals: Making your way around the group, each person must shout out a new word. If they hesitate, they are eliminated.
