# Train

## Description
Ask delegates to make train noises and actions with their arms. Take them on a journey and start moving the train.

The track is wild and varied! Gather speed through a valley, slowing to climb a hill, speeding up as they come down the hill, putting on the brakes to stop in a station and slowly starting up the train again. The person at the front then moves to the back and the next person takes over.

Make loud sound affects and move the group corresponding to the route. You may relate the journey to local place names.
