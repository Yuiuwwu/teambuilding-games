# Impersonations

## Description
Group is in a circle. Take it in turns to impersonate other members of the group and the others have to guess who it is. Try to avoid being cruel/racist/overly offensive.

Very good for an examination of body language. Can increase self-awareness. Probably something to be played at a later stage when personal barriers are broken down and people have a fairly good understanding of what the other members of the group are like.
