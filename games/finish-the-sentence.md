# Finish the Sentence

## Description
The group stands in a circle. One person starts a sentence by saying one word. The person next to this person has to say another word, the one next to that another, etc. This goes on until someone cannot think of a word to continue with. 
Bear in mind that these sentences have to be grammatically correct. 

The person that is unable to say a word, cannot continue the game and has to sit down. This way it is clear who is still in, and who is out. The game continues with another sentence. The last person standing wins.
