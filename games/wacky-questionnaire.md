# Wacky Questionnaire

## Description
At some point during one of the first meetings, have each group member fill-out a questionnaire sheet. The sheet will have questions like: If you were a shoe, what would it be and why?; What is your most embarrassing moment?; What is your favorite college memory, to date?; What is the least favorite food you experienced while at college? Without telling names, tell us a funny story about one of your
roommates; If you could only watch one television show for the rest of your life, which one would it be and the reason(s) for your selection. If you could have dinner with one person, living or from history, who would that person be and what are your reasons for selecting him/her? These and other questions
are answered and collected. A committee, like the membership committee, cuts the questionnaires and organizes the responses from the group by each question. At different meetings, a question is selected and brought out to the group at the beginning of the meeting (or at some other point) and the slips
passed out. Each person with a slip must find the individual who wrote it, only if that person is present of course. This causes a nice mixing of the group and allows for a humorous re-introduction of the group members to one another. Later in the meeting, have people disclose their response to the group. This can provide for an energizing break to a meeting.
