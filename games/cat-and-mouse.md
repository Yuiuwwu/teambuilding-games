# Cat and Mouse

## Description
Form pairs. Each of the pairs links arms. Choose a pair who will start the game. Choose one to be the cat, the other is the mouse. The cat attempts to catch the mouse and tag it. If the cat succeeds, the roles change: the mouse becomes the cat and vice versa. The mouse can become safe by linking arms with any one of the pairs. The member of the pair that did not get linked to then becomes the mouse and is forced to unlink. That person, of course, can link to another pair. Play this game when everyone is too wild. Its pretty tiring.

## Description
Instead of tagging by touching the other person, you may use a ball to make the game a bit more challenging.\n\nThis can be adapted to your committee topic quite easily, by turning the players into your central actors. f.e. LIBE: The User is chased by Facebook/Google while all the others pretend they don't see until they become involved.
