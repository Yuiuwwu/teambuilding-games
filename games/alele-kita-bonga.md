# Alele Kita Bonga

## Description
This call and response song is about the worship of watermelons (or fish?). Position yourself in a big circle and have participants repeat these lyrics after you:

Whoops!
Alele!
Alele Kita Bonga!
A massa, massa, massa!
Eee aeeou-wee aeeou-wee aeeou-wah!

While doing so, you mime like this: On "Whoops!", you grab a tiny watermelon out of thin air. On "Alele!" you joyfully raise it up in the air, and show it to everyone on "Alele Kita Bonga!" not believing how lucky you are! On "A massa massa massa" you eat the imaginary tiny watermelon, and praise whatever higher being has presented you with this gift with "Eee aeeou-wee...".

On the next repetition, the watermelon has gotten bigger! It is now the size of an actual watermelon. Use both hands. The joy!

On the next repetition, the watermelon has gotten even bigger! It is now the size of a car tyre. Your shouts of praise grow louder as you struggle under the weight!

On the next repetition, the watermelon has gotten so big you collapse and fall to the ground (and everyone else with you)! You shout at the top of your voice as you bounce up and down to bite from it. This is peak watermelon. The song is over.
