# Number Concentration

## Description
Everyone is assigned a number. You have to remember this number.\nYou sit in a circle and everyone claps on their knees two times, then claps their hands 2 times and then snaps their fingers two times.\nOne person starts. This person is, say, number 2. You start by doing the routine, and when you snap your fingers, you say 2 and, say, 4. This means that its number 4s turn. The person that cannot keep his or her concentration and messes up the numbers, is out.
