# Over and Under

## Description
The group forms a line. 20 objects are put in front of the feet of the first\nperson who must pass them one by one to their neighbour behind them, however it is allowed to pass the objects only over their head. Once the object reaches the last persons in the row it must be passed back to the front, this time being passed through the legs.
