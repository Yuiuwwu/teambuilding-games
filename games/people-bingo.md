# People Bingo

## Description
Prepare a 5 x 5 grid, like a Bingo grid. \nIn all the spaces, write things like:"Born in another country" or "Youngest child in family" and so on. (make the items as interesting as possible, yet still 'achievable'; fill in all the grids with items of interest to the participants.), one copy for each participant, either a photocopy or hand copy.\n\nThe participants mingle and ask each other questions - they receive a signature (max one signature per meeting, multiple meetings possible) of a person who meets the criteria for each section.\nYou may want to impose a rule that a participant can only sign another participants paper in a maximum of two spots.\n\nThe first participant with a completed card wins.

## Description
Alternatively: the games ends with the first full set.\nAfterward, facilitator reads out the answers and people point to the person who signed their paper.
