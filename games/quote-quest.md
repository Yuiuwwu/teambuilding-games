# Quote Quest

## Description
On the other side of the cards with letters of the alphabet, write one or two words of a famous quote. The quote may have some significance to the groups purpose. Avoid selecting an "esoteric" or difficult quote. Also, arrange the words on the cards so each word of the quote is represented. This will result in some cards only having one word and other may have multiple words. Be sure to include all capitalization and punctuation. This will assist the group in constructing the sentence. Have the group arrange themselves in order to make a quote that makes sense. Once they have arranged themselves, have the group "read" the quote by each person speaking the word(s) in succession. This will serve as an accuracy check for the group and give each person a chance to speak in front of the group. The facilitator can choose to provide hints or not. By not offering hints and looking upon this exercise as an initiative, the leader(s) will receive some insights about the dynamics of the group (who are the people who exert some leadership, whose involved and who is not, how well are people communicating, how "at-ease" do people feel, etc.

## Description
Use a quote that is relevant to the committee topic in order to make it relevant for the group.
