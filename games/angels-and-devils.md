# Angels and Devils

## Description
The group members stand up and form a circle. Ask them to choose two people: One, who will be their personal "devil" and one who will be their "angel". They must not tell which person they have chosen.

When you say “Go”, the group members try to stay away "as far as possible" from their devil while staying "as close as possible" to their angel. This exercise is quite quick and does require a lot of space.

## Description
Triangles: Ask them to choose two people that are going to form the other two sides of a triangle. They must not indicate which person they have chosen.

When you say “Go”, ask the delegates to try to form an equilateral triangle (all three sides equally long) with the two other people they chose. They should be milling about trying to stay at an equal distance from their chosen sides!
