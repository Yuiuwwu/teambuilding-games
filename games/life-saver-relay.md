# Life Saver Relay

## Description
Divide group into two teams. Give everyone a toothpick to hold between their teeth. Place a life saver/polo on the toothpick of the first person on each side. The game begins. The life saver/polo is passed from person to person by lining up the toothpicks so that the life saver slides onto the next person's toothpick. No one can use their hands. Should a lifesaver/polo be dropped, the team begins again with the first person. The first team to relay a lifesaver to the end of the line is the winner.
