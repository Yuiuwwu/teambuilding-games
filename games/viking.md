# Viking

## Description
All of the players sit in a circle. One person starts as the Viking by putting their fingers at their side of their head like horns on their hat. This Viking passes the role of being a Viking by pointing their horns at someone. If you are pointed at, you become a Viking (horns and all) and the person on the right has to start paddling to the right and the person on the left has to start paddling on the left. The last person of the threesome to assume their position is out. The rest of the players slap their legs during the game in a constant rhythm.
