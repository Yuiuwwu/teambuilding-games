# Blip Blop

## Description
Everybody stands in a circle. A pen (or an other small object) is passed from hand to hand in this way:
- This is a Blip
- A What?
- That is a Blip.
The person who receives it, passes it on by saying the same, but it is only the first person who knows what is really is so it is always going back to the first person. At the same time another pen is passed on the other way, this pen is called Blop. Every body needs to be quite aware and awake.

## Description
Gradually adding more items can make this quite challenging.
