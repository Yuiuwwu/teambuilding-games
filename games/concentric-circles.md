# Concentric Circles

## Description
Divide the group in two. Have one half make a circle facing outward. The others then form a circle around the first group facing inward, with everyone facing someone from the other circle. \n\nEach person can talk to their 'partner' for a minute or two before you yell, "SWITCH" \nand have one circle move to the next person on their left. If participants seem shy, give them a topic to talk about each rotation, such as movies, college, food, etc.
