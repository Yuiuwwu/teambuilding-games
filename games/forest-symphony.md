# Forest Symphony

## Description
Divide delegates in at least 3-4 groups of comparable size and number or name the groups.\nTake each group separately and teach them a relatively quiet sound to make, either with their voices, hands or feet. Allow them a moment to practice.\n\nReassemble the whole group, eyes closed, and pick a group (e.g. #1), who will start making their sound.\nThen pick another group who joins in with their sound, introducing all groups slowly. The end-result should sound like a forest or sea or anything you prefer.\n\nWith a very talented group, you can assign each group two sounds (difficult, though!).
