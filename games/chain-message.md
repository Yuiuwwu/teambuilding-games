# Chain Message

## Description
Ask delegates to stand in a line. The Chair whispers to a person at the back of the line the first sentence of a story (e.g., Seven tall men walked into a bar).

The first person then whispers the sentence to the next person. The next person has to add a second line and whisper both lines to the person in front of them. This sequence continues with each additional participant adding another line until each reaches the front of the line where this person is asked to tell the story. You can add a variation to this story where the group also has to tell the story backwards by going back down the line again.
