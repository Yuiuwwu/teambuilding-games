# Silent Name Game

## Description
This should be the first name game played in the group. Make the group\n(dont say a word!) sit in a circle. Show them a piece of paper telling them not to\nspeak during the upcoming 10 minutes. Subsequent instructions ask them to get to know each others' names. Once theyre finished with this task, point out one person and ask the others to say this persons name. Go around the group.
