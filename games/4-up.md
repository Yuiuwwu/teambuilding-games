# 4-Up

## Description
Have all the members sit. Select a number of people according to the size of the group and name the game accordingly.

Everyone else needs to put their heads down so that they canâ€™t see. The selected stand up and come to the front. The individuals up front will walk around. Each one will tag a person and then the tagged must stick their thumb up. When the individuals return to the front, all members can then lift up their heads. The delegates with their thumbs up must guess who touched them. If they guess right, they get to switch places. If they guess wrong, they stay down for another round.
