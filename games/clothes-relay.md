# Clothes Relay

## Description
Players form teams (the number of teams as well as the number of team
members is up to the facilitator). They take off articles of clothing and try to see which team can make the longest line out of their clothes. Sometimes girls will take off shirts and finish relay in bras! :) Any item you are wearing at the time, counts if you take it off and put it in the line. You can set up a time limit to make the game even more challenging.
