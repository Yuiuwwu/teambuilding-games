# Skin the Snake

## Description
All delegates line up one behind another. Each delegate puts their right hand forward as if they were shaking hands. Put left hand through own legs behind to shake hands with person behind you. Without breaking the chain, start the game:
The last person has to crawl forward, through the legs of all the others to stand back up at the front.

## Description
The last person in the line lies down on their back. Everyone else backs up to be able to lie down also. When whole group is lying down, first person stands up, and walks forward over all the other people until the "snake" has skinned itself. Be careful not to step on them!
