# Colour Blinds

## Description
Different coloured markers and flipcharts or whiteboard.\nUsing at least four different coloured markers, the Facilitator writes the names of colours on the board using a different colour pen.\nFor example the word "Red" is written in blue pen, "Green" is written in red, "Blue" in black and "Black" in green.\nCreate a long list beforehand and keep on changing the colours of the words.\n\nAs a group, they have to shout out the name of the colour, not the word, in turn as the chair points to them.\nThen do through it again where they have to shout out the word instead.\nYou are eliminated if you say the wrong colour/word!
