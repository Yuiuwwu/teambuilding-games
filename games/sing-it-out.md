# Sing it Out!

## Description
Teambuilder asks delegates different open-ended questions. Participants have to have reasoned answers but they have to sing them out. Teambuilder acts as a conductor gradually asking more serious questions while making delegates sing more quietly, thus getting them into a working mode.
