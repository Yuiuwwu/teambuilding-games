# Mexican Traffic Police

## Description
Divide the group teams (size irrelevant, 3 or more). Each team is given the same number of beans, so that each participant has 2 or 3 beans. 

Everybody runs in every direction, pretending to be cars, buses, trucks, horses, donkey carts, fire engines, etc. (make noises). Feel free to yell out Spanish words! (Ole! Adios! Burrito! La Cucaracha!) The traffic in Mexico City
is, after all, very busy and very noisy. 

One person is the Traffic Police Officer. When the Officer holds up her hand, all the traffic must stop. Any vehicle that is caught moving must pay a fine of 1 bean. At the end of the game (facilitator chooses), the teams count their beans. The team with the most beans is the winner.
