# I'm Here & I'm Happy!

## Description
Make the group stand in a circle. On a sign given by the facilitator everybody
starts screaming their name - the louder, the better! Then make them scream
'Im happy! or 'Im here! in their own languages in the same way - at the same
time, the louder, the better. Once theyve finished, make them scream their
name and the powerful sentence one by one in a round.
