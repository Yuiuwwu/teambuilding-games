# Ah So Ko!

## Description
Participants form a circle. Introduce the following hand gestures:
- Ah (hand under the chin palm facing the floor).
- So (hand at forehead, in salute fashion).
- Ko (arm and hand out in front of you pointing at another player).

One person starts with "Ah", while facing another participant. That person follows with "So", looking at the next person, who continues with "Ko" and so on around the circle. If someone messes up they are "out of the game" and step out of the circle. The person to their right has a silent 3 second count to start the game again
with "Ah". The game continues until 2-3 people are left (up to you whether the last 2 compete for Ah So Ko champion title!).
