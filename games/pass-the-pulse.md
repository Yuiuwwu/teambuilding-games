# Pass the Pulse

## Description
Everybody intertwines their arms and holds hands with their eyes closed. The facilitator is the generator of the "pulse". The facilitator starts with passing the "pulse" by squeezing the hand of the person to their right or left. The person who just received the pulse then squeezes the other hand he/she is holding, and the process continues on throughout the group. The pulse should travel around the circle a couple of times, with the facilitator passing it just like everyone else. When this pulse is travelling, you can send a new pulse. Then game ends when the facilitator progressively stop all of the pulses.
