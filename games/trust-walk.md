# Trust Walk

## Description
Delegates are taken outside if possible. Explain to the delegates that they will be going on a trust walk with a partner. One of the pair is instructed to close their eyes and be guided around. They will be blindfolded for half the time, and then swap to become the one responsible for the safety of their blindfolded partner for the rest of the time. Blindfold one of each of the pairs. Have the \"seeing\" delegates tell the \"blind\" ones to go forward, up the hill etc.. the \"seeing\" delegate should hold the arm of the blindfolded one for safety but not to guide!
