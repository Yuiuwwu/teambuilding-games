# Dizzy Race

## Description
Divide the people into their patrols and then line them up (lines spaced about 2
arm's widths away) facing a position 6 metres away. In front of each line (at the 6m position), make a mark on the ground (chalk or drawn on the ground). 

When a whistle is blown, the first person in each line must run as fast as they can to the mark on the ground, and keeping her index finger on the mark, turn around 15 times. After this, they must run back (if they can!!) to their line and touch the hand of the next person, who then does the same. 

The first team to get all their members back is the winner. This game makes you EXTREMELY dizzy, so make sure there is enough room to move around in!
