# Dance-onary

## Description
Group is split up in two (guys/girls or anything else, doesnt matter). The game is similar to Pictionary, however, the participants are asked to act out a certain dance style, which the other group members have to guess. The chair shows them a paper with the dance style on it. Points go to the group that has guessed first. The groups rotate in who has to dance. \n\nDances can include, but are not limited to: Moonwalk, Waltz, Twist, Line dance, Dance like an Egyptian, Single ladies, Ballet, Robot, Shopping cart, Rock 'n roll, Can can, Bellydancing, Bollywood, Breakdance, Cheerleading, Disco, Tango, Hiphop, Jumpstyle, Limbo, Macarena, Polonaise, Raindance, Tapdance, Vogue.\n\nAim of the energizer is to let the delegates both feel confortable in the committee by doing something weird/embarrassing and have a good laugh, as well as great a group spirit.
