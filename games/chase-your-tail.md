# Chase Your Tail

## Description
The group stands in a line (one behind the other) and wraps their arms around the waist of the person in front. (You can name the creature just formed any animal you want. Animal sounds add to the fun.) 
The last person in line dons the "tail", a bandana tucked into the belt or waistband. The object of the game is for the head to capture the tail (grab the bandana). When this happens the head becomes the new tail and the second in line becomes the head. 

Participants in the middle of the line can decide to help either the head or the tail and can switch allegiance at will. Larger groups can form more than one animal and each animal can chase its own tail or the tail of another animal.
