# Artifact Game

## Description
Each person is told ahead of time to bring ten objects with some meaning to them to whatever event you are doing this at. 

When they arrive, the facilitator gives them a bag with a number on it and has them carefully place their objects in it. Each person then receives someone else's bag. 

Participants have ten minutes to write down ideas about what the person who owns the objects is like, and to try to guess who they are. The 'results' are then presented in a round (participants towards then end of the round will know who 'their' objects belong to, but should tell the group who they thought things belonged to.

This also works as an end of meeting game, to see what people have learned about each other.

## Description
The person behind the objects can also be discussed by the entire group (either before or after the presenter has given his guess) - it should be made sure, then, that the person whose objects are being discussed does not give the game away.
