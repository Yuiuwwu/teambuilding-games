# Pass the Key

## Description
Divide the group into two equally numbered teams. Arrange the teams so they face one another. Team members then join hands. This leaves two "free" hands on each team (the two people at the ends of each line). Give a single key to one of the "end" people on each team. The tasks is to pass the key from one end to the other without unclasping the hands of the team. The key cannot be passed or kicked along the ground. If the key drops, it must be picked up while all hands remain clasped.
