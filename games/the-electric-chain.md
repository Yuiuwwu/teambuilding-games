# The electric chain

## Description
People have to stand in a circle holding their right thumb and index in an 'O.K. sign, while keeping the right hand at the same level as their shoulder. The left index is to be placed inside the hole created by the person standing to the left.

As the chair/trainer says 'go, each person has to try to stick their left index out of the hole, while catching the fingers of the person to their right.

The winners are those who manage to free their index and catch the one of the person standing to their right. All winners form a new circle, and the game goes on until one outsmarts all the others.
