# Human Spring

## Description
In pairs, ask delegates to stand facing one another with arms positioned elbows at right angles, palms facing partner. Delegates should start standing approximately half a meter apart.

Put hands out and keep feet firmly in place throughout. Partners lean forward so that hands meet flat against one another with no interlocking fingers (keeping elbows in) and push against one another creating a springboard.

Partners then take small steps back, repeating the activity at increasingly further distances apart. The objective is for partners to complete the activity, standing as far apart as possible while maintaining safety and a sense of trust.
