# Birdie on the Perch

## Description
Have everyone in the group find a partner. One set of partners form a circle and the other set forms another circle on the outside of the first group. Each partner should be facing each other and in opposite circles. 
Start playing music and have the inside circle walk one direction and the outside circle walk the opposite direction. When the music stops, the pairs must find each other again and form the birdie on the perch (one partner kneeling on one knee and second partner sitting on that persons knee). The last pair to form the Birdie on the perch is out of the game. Continue placing until only one pair is left - they are the winners!
