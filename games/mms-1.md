# M&M's 1

## Description
Ask each person to pour themselves a small handful of M&M's. Then from their\n￼￼handful, ask them to put aside a candy with each of their three most favourite colour. \n\nOnce everyone has chosen their colours, put up a poster with questions on, one for every colour one (e.g. "If you could go anywhere in the world, where would it be?")\n\nThen go around the group and have each person tell the group their answers for each of their three coloured M&M's.

## Description
Pour M&M's. Make sure that nobody has two M&M's of the same colour. Then make a round asking them to say one thing for each colour i.e. yellow - something sunny about themselves, red - an embarrassing moment, black - the most frightening moment of their lives, green - the best memory from their childhood etc.)
