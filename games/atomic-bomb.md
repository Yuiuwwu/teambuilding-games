# Atomic Bomb

## Description
Prepare a pipe (about 5cm diameter) by drilling 15-20 holes in it. The pipe has a solid bottom and an open top. Put a ping-pong ball inside it and hang it so that the top of the pipe is at about 2m height.\n\nThe ping-pong ball that has to be removed without turning the pipe around. You provide a number of tools, one of them a bucket (make sure there's water/a fossett close). Ideally they should cover the holes on the pipe with their fingers, while one person puts water in the bucket and picks the ball up.\n\nAfter the ball is retrieved and everyone releases their fingers, the \"atomic bomb\" will explode.

## Description
You could offer the delegates a number of additional confusing tools, you could hang the pipe higher or only give them the bucket, without water.
