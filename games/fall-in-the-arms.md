# Fall in the Arms

## Description
The group splits up into pairs. One of the two must let themselves fall backwards into the arms of the other. Start by having the pairs stand close to one another, so that the fall is very gentle. The pairs can choose to, step-by-step, move further and further apart. Safety first!

After a few 'falls' the pairs should switch roles.
