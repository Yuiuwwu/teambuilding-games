# Funky Chicken

## Description
The group forms a circle. Everyone is instructed to sing along with the song. Every time a new person is introduced (starting with the 'Funky Chicken'), to which a certain move belongs. The facilitator starts, and from that point on every new person/animal is made up by a different member of the group. Examples of famous people to introduce are: Michael Jackson, Britney Spears, Michael Jordan, etc. The lyrics are as follows:\n\nOne two three four five six seven eight/\nLet me see your Funky Chicken/\n(What did you say?)/\nI said: Let me see your Funky Chicken/\n(What did you say?)/\n\n[the following is accompanied by the moves:]\nI said: Oh - ah ah ah - Oh - ah ah ah/\nOh - ah ah ah - Oh - one more time/\nI said: Oh - ah ah ah - Oh - ah ah ah/\nOh - ah ah ah - Oh - back in line/\n\n[On 'one two three four five six seven eight' everyone takes 8 steps forward, on 'back in line' they return to their original position]
